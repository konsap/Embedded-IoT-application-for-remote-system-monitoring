# Embedded-IoT-application-for-remote-system-monitoring

This project was developed as a final project for the "Advanced Topics in Information Systems" of the "Control and Computing" master's programme. The project was inspired by smart home/garden/etc applications and with a few modifications can be turned into one.


The application consists of two major components:

1) The first is a microcontroller which is responsible for acquiring data from environmental sensors, controlling the LEDs (act as proxies for relays) and hosting a server application. 

2) The second is the Android app, with which a user can monitor the sensors and control the LEDs.

The presentation included in this repo provides an overview of the functionality of the project.
