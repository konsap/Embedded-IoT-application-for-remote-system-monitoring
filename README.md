# Embedded-IoT-application-for-remote-system-monitoring

This project was developed as a final project for the "Advanced Topics in Information Systems" class of the "Control and Computing" master's programme. The project was inspired by smart home/garden applications and with a few modifications can be turned into either one of those.


The application consists of two major components:

1) The first is a microcontroller which is responsible for acquiring data from environmental sensors, controlling the LEDs (act as proxies for relays) and hosting a server application. 

2) The second is the Android app, that connects to the server hosted on the microcontroller. Through the app, a user can monitor the sensors and control the LEDs (or other devices).

The presentation included in this repo provides an overview of the functionality of the project.
